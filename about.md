'_Mote_' is derived from the phrase '_emotional artifact_'â€”which is a brief encapsulation of the theory of art proposed by Leo Tolstoy in _On Art_.

Without having to go too deep, the main theory is that 'art' is that which communicates a unique (and uniting, given Tolstoy's moral constraints*) emotional experience, whereby the emotion is in harmony with the form of which it is expressed.

Because 'art' is a term that has been weighed upon by various philosophers and given differing meanings throughout the years such that it hardly means anything to anyone, I have abandoned the term and instead use the term 'mote' (to refer to a work of art).


*I think it suffices to lift the moral constraint so that we can avoid debates on moral values; any works that _also_ meet some moral constraint(s) can be referred to as '_moral motes_.'
