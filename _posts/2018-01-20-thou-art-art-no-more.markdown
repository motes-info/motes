So, a few months ago, I found myself at an Austin Bitcoin conference. I had been off the circuit for a few years, but my rambunctious Sancho Panza, Doogie Howser, had acquired more than a soupçon of tickets to recent conventions—just enough to be a proper Libertarian thermometer. 
 
In the early days of all this digital madness, the core proponents—or perhaps, more precisely, core adopters, enthusiasts—of Hal's bmoney, were the crazy, fringe libertarians. You may know them: they're the people that like the anarchy symbol that _aren't_ semi-mentally-ill teenagers. Mind you, this is not a dig at libertarians or their core principles; I was there, after all. (Unfortunately not in the very early days when I was still a high school student, but I found fractional reserve banking very distasteful and was sneaking digs at the Federal Reserve in my English papers my junior year—if only I had been told about Bitcoin in those days!) 

At any rate, the bulk of the community at the time I became aware of the Bitcoin thing consisted of individuals that were at least slightly nerdy and slightly libertarian. The meet ups and tradeshows I attended carried the libertarian sentiment, with a whiff of social awkwardness and axe body spray. 
 
What dearest Doogie Howser conveyed to me early on was an observation he had made of this convention relative to many of the others he had attended that year: there was a very strong early days, libertarian feel. Over time, as awareness has spread, a large portion of the community has turned out to be speculators, but Doogie Howser was appreciating the madeleine that made him hearken back to the predominately borderline-anarchist days. There clearly must have been a strong enough libertarian scent, as Darkcoin had picked up on it and set up a trap/booth there (they are rather vexingly pursuing the community, on a pancreatic-cancer kind of level). 

It was during the after party of the final day (in which the organizers of the after party, whom had no actual affiliation with the convention scammed some people out of more than Roger Ver paid as the sponsor of the actual convention—the spot they got was a coffee shop booth! A nice coffee shop, but it's downright ridiculous), where I was talking with anthropic Anthem and a nice feller that's with ConsenSys running GRID+. 

The ConsenSys feller—let's call him Karl—was temporarily on the subject of Libertarianism and the some sort of stigma that the word 'libertarian' has developed that makes it difficult to refer to its ideals without derailing conversation. His approach, he informed me, to leaping over this communicative hurdle was to simply refer to the same ideals, but with a new, unsoiled word: electivism. 

"I'm stealing that," I said. 

And now, I shall. 

The rest of this article has little to do with the beginning, as a warning. 

I'm fairly certain if I ever bothered to open up the degree I graduated with, I'd find that I technically have an arts degree, so I suppose I am technically qualified to type words into my phone about about that which my degree is presumably in. 

**Art!** I'm a bit of a Tolstoy obsessive, having read several of his fictional works and getting hooked enough to go for his non-fiction. 

I've read _On Art_ at least six times in the past two years (largely trying to ensure that the translation was accurate). I've carried it around with me every day on my daily trek, tumbling on the train, glancing at it periodically when I've felt the need to refer back to a particular passage. 

For the purposes of this article, we will not cover Tolstoy's application of a particular branch of moral principles that he uses to make judgments on particular works of art—as these sections seem to cause those in some form of disagreement (with the principles or the stigmas they may have associated with Tolstoy's terminology) recoil and pass over this otherwise agreeable theory. 

I'm convinced that it is the most cohesive, most complete theory of art to date, and it seems to have fallen by the wayside (or at least in the Western, English-speaking Philistine-plebeian realm I inhabit). The only rare references I have seen to it that bring it up the context of art in general pass over it somewhat to talk about other, chronological theories of art—this is a mistake. 

The main essay (_What is Art_) has, as one of its main veins, the notion that art institutions are having a overall detrimental effect on the art their students could potentially produce. I suppose it isn't too surprising that art institutions pass over theories of art that suggests to their students that art schools are bad. 

Without having to go too deep, the main theory is that art is that which communicates a unique (and uniting, with Tolstoy's moral constraints) emotional experience, whereby the emotion is in harmony with the form of which it is expressed. 

Tolstoy does go on to say that there's three key ways of counterfeiting art: imitation, striking, and interest. For clarity, we'll define them in terms of appeals. We have (1) "appeal to familiarity," whereby an imitator makes a bad reflection of the art of others that the viewer already recognizes as art. (2) "Appeal to the sensory"; this takes the form of using a medium to convey that which is much more easily conveyed in another medium. (3) "Appeal to the intellect"; aka _Inception_. 

Perhaps later we'll explore Tolstoy's definitions, but at this point I merely wish to convey my thievery. 

The same way Karl avoided warped meanings—that is what I intend to steal. 

I like Tolstoy's definition far too much to let other definitions of art into the mix and muddy up my meanings, so we will henceforth refer to art as '_decomposing squabs_'. 

(That's a placeholder. Still working out the name . . .)
