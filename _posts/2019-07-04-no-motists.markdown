To prevent the often indefatigable and indefinable force (humanity) that has destroyed and defiled the mainstream understanding of _art_ from wreaking the same havoc on the very narrow meaning that has been purposefully given to the new word _mote_, we must make note of the predominant manner in which _art_ was so ruthlessly ravaged.

Institutes! The scourge. They are capitalist enterprises (no political overtones intended) painfully masquerading as some kind of public utility. Their goal is to sell the school to as many prospective students as possible. Sure, they askantly acquire deluded staff and convoluted lecturers as a means of drawing in dreary drawers, paining painters, sclerous sculptors, muscle-atrophied musicians, pleasantless playwrights, and the like ⁠— but this is all to collect tuition from the so-called aspiring artists lacking the intuition to craft from within.

As emotional uniquity cannot really be taught and is only very rarely plucked from one's own personal experiences, the art institutes have to scrounge up something resembling a curriculum in something resembling art.

Here, they reduce art to craft, and destroy the meaning of art in the process. They teach techniques in how one can produce works that appear to be art by the superfluous standards of art that they themselves have made up. It's all a gosh-darn farce!

The three main techniques that that students learn by osmosis:
* Appeals to familiarity (imitation): whereby one takes features from renowned works and incorporates them clumsily into their own work.
* Appeals to the sensory (striking): whereby one uses one medium to convey that which is better conveyed through another medium.
* Appeals to the intellect: whereby one produces works that operate on conceptual levels rather than emotional ones.

The way I see it is that if we make a central tenet of _motism_ that there can be no _motists_ (those that identify and label themselves as those who produce _motes_), then we will have relieved the pressure of requiring individuals to feel compelled to produce _motes_, which eliminates the necessity for techniques in mass-producing works.

There can be no _motists_. There are only individual human beings.
