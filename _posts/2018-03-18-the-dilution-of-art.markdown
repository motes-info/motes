At least in how I was taught the modern, colloquial definition of '_art_' in public schools where the art teachers either were stoners or those who had suffered lobotomies, the meaning of the word '_art_' had been conflated with the word '_craft_.'

Judging how infrequently the term '_craft_' is used outside of the phrase '_hone [your/my] craft_' indicates that '_craft_' really has given up most of its meaning to the term '_art_.'

A '_craft_' was simply a work of skill that did not meet the full criteria of art. Because the criteria of '_art_' had been debated and changed throughout the years (and broadened), '_craft_' had less and less use.

I still like the word '_craft_' and I will continue to use itâ€”only, it'll refer to works that do not meet the qualifications of being '_decomposing squabs_.'
