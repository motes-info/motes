I've found a term better than '_decomposing squabs_'.

A work of art is a '_mote_'. 

The plural of '_mote_' is '_motes_.'

'_Mote_' is derived from the phrase '_emotional artifact_'—which is a brief encapsulation of the theory of art proposed by Tolstoy that I recognize as truth but has fallen into obscurity with the rampant commercialization of '_art_' enabled by technology that has warped the meaning to the point where I can no longer use the word to describe what I want it to.
