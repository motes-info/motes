I haven't been thinking much on this subject, but I had a thought today that perhaps the distinction between moral and immoral works made by Tolstoy is unnecessary.

Or at least, unnecessary if one is relying on a moral system built on their own moral sense. If you are aware of your own moral sense, a work that focuses on experiences that violate your moral sensibilities, you will feel that violation and it will be a part of the experience that better informs your awareness of your own moral sense.

So, "immoral" motes help you be more moral just as much as "moral" motes do. Classifying and blacklisting motes as "immoral" only has a detrimental effect.
